DOCUMENTATION

* We should have a section about multiple language
  whole lots of /LANGs but no explaintation :)

* user_vars should link to the user_vars section as in the old docs
  callbacks and other stuff should be linked too
 
* not so important but could be nice, links to examples in the examples directory for every function
  every function will link to the example file that containts it

* default values bolded or something alike

* go over everything and search for mistakes :)
