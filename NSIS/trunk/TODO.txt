-- NSIS 2 Beta 4 --

NSIS

* SetCurInstType should work without the components page

* component page for uninstaller, multiple sections

* more default texts in NLF language files

* all installer strings should be language strings

* make temp (for compress whole) creation better (and verify it exists)

* move no custom to compiler (custom as just another inst type)

* empty subsections should not show

-- Before NSIS 2 Final --

EXAMPLES

* write an advanced paging example showing multiple components page with multiple
  instfiles pages

NSIS

* skip plugin calls, file instructions that add more than one file with +1 with goto

* different color for the drive space when there is not enough space

* more powerful plug-ins (access to ExecFunc and flags and even more)

* ChangeUI RTL full support

* LZMA compression

PLUGINS

* InstallOptions - custom class names so you can include whatever control you want

* nsExec - live output
