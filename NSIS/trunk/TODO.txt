TODO

NSIS

* SetCurInstType should work without the components page

* empty subsections should not show

* start optimizing datablock after file mapping was released

* map files part by part to save memory

* skip plugin calls, file instructions that add more than one file with +1 with goto

* more powerful plug-ins (access to ExecFunc and flags and even more)

* LZMA compression

EXAMPLES

* write an advanced paging example showing multiple components page with multiple
  instfiles pages

PLUGINS

* InstallOptions - custom class names so you can include whatever control you want

* nsExec - live output
