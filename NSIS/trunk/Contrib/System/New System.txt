Additional notes:
1. if you are using callbacks you should set SetPluginUnload 
to alwaysoff.
2. If you are using inline input syntax, you shouldn't use the same quotes for
quoting inlines and the whole defenition. Use \ as escape character (for ex.:
\" will be replaced with ").

----------- Main functions -----------

RESULT/PROC System::Get "Proc"
RESULT/RETURN System::Call "Proc" StackArgs...

These functions return error RESULTs or PROC/RETURN in OK case.
Error result is "error" and callback results are "callbackN", where N is
callback index.

----------- Additional functions -----------

System::Int64Op ARG1 OP1
System::Int64Op ARG1 OP2 ARG2
        Performs operation on ARG1 and ARG2 (or on ARG1 only at single argument
operator cases) and returns result on stack. Here are the OP2s: +, -, *, / DIV, 
% MOD, | OR, & AND, ^ XOR, || LOGIC-OR, && LOGIC-AND, < BELOW, > ABOVE, = EQUAL. 
There are only 2 OP1s: ~ (BITWISE-NOT) and ! (LOGIC-NOT).

System::Alloc SIZE
        Allocates SIZE bytes and returns the pointer on stack.

System::Copy 0 SOURCE
System::Copy DESTINATION SOURCE
System::Copy /SIZE 0 SOURCE 
System::Copy /SIZE DESTINATION SOURCE 
        Copys data from source to destination, if /SIZE option and SIZE itself
are undefined uses GlobalSize to determine source size. If destination is equal
to 0, allocates the new memory block.

System::Free ADDR
System::Free /callback ADDR
        Frees memory used by object at ADDR. If /callback option is specified,
then ADDR is considered to be the addr of CALLBACK proc, and will be cleared
accordingly (must be used!).

----------- Get/Call syntaxis -----------

Syntax:
        "Proc(Params)Return?Options#Proc(Params)Return?Options..."

Proc:
        dll::proc       -> Proc from DLL
        ::addr          -> Handle to system proc (memory address)
        *addr           -> Structure
        *               -> New structure
        nothing         -> Dup proc, usually callback or for future defenition

        proc            -> Ready proc specification for use or redefinition


        If in System::Call proc specification points to already existing proc,
the existing proc will be adapted and executed, otherwise the new proc will be
created, executed and deleted.

Params syntax: (Param1, Param2, Param3...), the number of params of proc is set
to number of params at last Params section (so params cutting may ocur). If you 
need to save previous Param defenition use '_' after last param at Params 
section - no param cutting will ocur for it (section).
Syntax of single param: "Type Source Destination", type can be omitted (previous
or void will be used), each of Source and Destination can be replaced with 
'.' placeholder. Any parameter can be omitted at all - previous or default 
values will be used (example: "(i1,,i2)", 2nd arg omitted).

        Return section is like single param defenition, but the Source defenition is 
never used, beside callback cases.

Params & Return - Type:
        v - void (generaly for return)
        i - int (includes char, byte, short, handles, pointers and so on)
        l - long & large integer (know as int64)
        t - text, string (LPCSTR, pointer to first character)
        b - boolean (needs/returns 'true':'false') - by the fact this type is 
                senseless -> usual integer can be used ('0':'1')
        k - callback. See Callback section.

        * - pointer specifier -> the proc needs the pointer to type, affects
                next char (parameter) [ex: '*i' - pointer to int]

For structures: & - additional meaning specificator.
        &v      - padding, &vN - pad for N bytes
        &i      - smaller types: &i4, &i2 (short), &i1 (byte)
        &t      - structure contains plain text, &tN - lenght == N bytes.

Params & Return - Source / Destination:
        . - makes no change to source
        0..9 - starts numeric inline input (accepts 0..9, x, |)
        " / ' / ` - starts / ends string inline input, use \ to escape chars
        Registers $0-$9 -> r(0..9)
        Registers $R0-$R9 -> 'r(10..19)' or 'R(0..9)'
        Additional regs -> c(Cmdline) d(instDir) o(Outdir) e(Exedir) a(lAng)
        Stack -> s (you could pass arguments from Call line, see examples)
        None -> n (0 (null) for input / specifies no output is required)

Options (any option can be turned off (returned to default value) by specifing
'!' where needed, for example _stdcall cc can be turned on by '!c'):
        c - _cdecl calling convention (the stack restored by caller). By default
stdcall calling convention is used (the stack restored by callee).
        r - always return (for GET means you should pop result and proc,
for CALL means you should pop result (at least)). By default result is returned
for errors only (for GET you will pop either error result or right 
proc, and for CALL you will get either your return or result at defined 
return place.
        n - no redefine. Whenever this proc will be used it will never be 
redefined either by GET or CALL. This options is never inherited to childs.
        s - use general Stack. Whenever the first callback defined the system
starts using the temporary stacks for function calls. 

Callback: you should check for callbacked return after every function call
which can use your callback. Genereal scheme is:
        1. Check result for callback or normal return
        2. Input arguments defined for callback are at places.
        3. Place output and return arguments
        4. Call System::Call using callback proc handle
