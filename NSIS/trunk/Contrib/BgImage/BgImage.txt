BgImage.DLL - NSIS extension DLL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays an image behind the NSIS window.
Can also play WAVs.

Note
~~~~

All but the last used function (which should be Destroy) must use /NOUNLOAD so the image window won't be destroyed before it should. Therefore, this DLL requires NSIS 2.0a7 and above.
