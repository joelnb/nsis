nsExec
------
nsExec will execute command-line based programs and capture the output
without opening a dos box.

Usage
-----
nsExec::Exec path [/TIMEOUT=x]

-or-

nsExec::ExecToLog path [/TIMEOUT=x]

Both functions are the same except ExecToLog will print the output
to the logwindow.

The timeout value is optional and is used to set the time in 
milliseconds for the dll to wait for the process to return
before it quits.

Return Value
------------
If nsExec is unable to execute the process, it will return "error"
on the top of the stack, else it returns "success".
