nsExec
------
nsExec will execute command-line based programs and capture the output
without opening a dos box.


Usage
-----
nsExec::Exec [/TIMEOUT=x] path

-or-

nsExec::ExecToLog [/TIMEOUT=x] path

Both functions are the same except ExecToLog will print the output
to the logwindow.

The timeout value is optional.  The timeout is the time in
milliseconds nsExec will wait for output.  If output from the
process is received, the timeout value is reset and it will
again wait for more output using the timeout value.  See Return 
Value for how to check if there was a timeout.


Return Value
------------
If nsExec is unable to execute the process, it will return "error"
on the top of the stack, if the process timed out it will return
"timeout", else it will return the return code from the
executed process.
