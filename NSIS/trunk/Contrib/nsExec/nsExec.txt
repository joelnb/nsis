nsExec
------
nsExec will execute command-line based programs and capture the output
without opening a dos box.


Usage
-----
nsExec::Exec [/TIMEOUT=x] path

-or-

nsExec::ExecToLog [/TIMEOUT=x] path

Both functions are the same except ExecToLog will print the output
to the logwindow.

The timeout value is optional and is used to set the time in 
milliseconds for the plugin to wait for the process to return
before it quits, or the time in milliseconds for the plugin
to wait for output to come out before it quits if using
ExecToLog. The default is no timeout.


Return Value
------------
If nsExec is unable to execute the process, it will return "error"
on the top of the stack, else it returns the return code from the
executed process.
